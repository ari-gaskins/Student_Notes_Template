This is a template for student notes in outline format. Can also just be used as an outline. Will be updating with JavaScript later.

Want to add: 
- Ability to create new topics, subtopics, and notes items using specific indentations
- page breaks and incremented page numbers
- (CSS) create page outline and shadows
- (Optional) could try turn the notes into a form that can be submitted and stored in database
